# simple-androids
RimWorld mod that introduces a new race of androids, with less bloat than Android tiers.


Note that Simple Androids is its own mod, and not related to Android tiers. Simple Androids makes it harder to construct androids due to their cost.


Requires De-Generalize Work (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2011655761) and Humanoid Alien Races (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=839005762)
